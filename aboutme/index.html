    <h2>Yuriro</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Edisson Ruiz, I have 31 years old, I am marry with a wonderful woman, we have 2 little children, 
        a boy of 4 years and a girl of 2 years, I am from TÃ¡chira, Venezuela, since December 2021 we live in Provo, Utah, 
        USA. We are very happy for the gospel in our live and all the blessings that God give us day by day. 
        I am very happy to continue my studies despite the limited time I have, because to migrate to a new country and 
        start from zero it is not easy, but God is great, and we can do His commandments.</p>
    <p>I like to play video games, since I was a child, I like warcraft in all its ways (dota, wow, building, etc.) 
        in actuality I play word of warcraft (but I don't know if I can continue playing for the little time I have jeje), 
        I like the history of the game, landscape design, the large number of characters and races, the gameplay, 
        I like that the game is very whole</p>
