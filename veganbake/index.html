                <P> Many vegan foods are rich in plant-based protein, which doesn't have the harmful health effects of animal-derived protein. 
                    Given how healthy plant-based foods can be, it's no wonder that more and more world-class athletes and other famous names
                    are opting to eat vegan. Check out some of the health benefits below: </P>
                <img class="food" src="images/food.png" alt="Vengan food">
                <p> 1. Vegan foods are rich in the nutrients your body needs. 
                    2. Eating vegan helps reduce our risk of suffering from cancer and other diseases. 
                    3. Vegan food can boost your mood. 
                    4. Eating vegan can help you achieve a healthy body weight. 
                    5. It can help prevent type 2 diabetes. 
                    6. Your skin may benefit, too. 
                    7. Eating vegan can reduce the pain of arthritis. </p>
                <p> Jeffrey Soble, MD, a cardiologist at Rush University Medical Center, began eating a plant-based diet nearly two year ago. 

                    Like others, improving his health — he has a family history of heart disease — played a significant role in that decision.
                    Research has shown that a vegan diet can help do the following: 
            
                    -Promote weight loss
                    -Reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels 
                    -Lower your chances of getting certain types of cancer, such as colon cancer       
                    -Manage diabetes by lowering A1C levels</p>

                <h2>Tips when making the change: </h2>

                <p> Explain your reasons for making the change. Your partner may decide to make the journey with you, or you may have to go it alone.
                    If you do choose to eat differently, discuss how that will work in terms of shopping, meal preparation and dining out. 

                    Take notes. 
                    Write down which vegan foods you've enjoyed in the past and where to get them. This can include prepared meals from
                    your local grocer, your preferred brand of soy yogurt or tasty entrées at nearby restaurants. This handy list will help
                    with last-minute meal planning, and help take the stress out of shopping and dining. 

                    Understand your own expectations. 
                    Will you ensure that every item you eat has no animal products by reading ingredient labels? Or will you take a different
                    approach and have a little ice cream at birthday parties? Veganism doesn't have to be all or nothing. Take a close look 
                    at your goals and objectives and do what works best for you. "By creating your own roadmap and being realistic about 
                    what you want to achieve, you'll be more satisfied with making the change," Soble says. </p>
